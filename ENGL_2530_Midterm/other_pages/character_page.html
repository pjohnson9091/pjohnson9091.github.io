        <h2>Some of the Characters in Beowulf and how they are important to the story.</h2>
        </section>

 <p class="char_list" id = "Beowulf"><b>Beowulf:</b> He is important to the story he is one of the major enforcers of the 
     heroic ideal. Many other "good guys" in the story would like to enforce it and try, but Beowulf is 
     the only one that is able to actually go through with it
 </p>
 <p class ="char_list" id = "Unferth"><b>Unferth:</b> He is important to emphasize how amazing Beowulf is,
    we can see this leading up to Beowulf's fight with Grendel where where he cast doubt on how powerful 
    Beowulf is by mentioning another character, that is only talked about once, Breca and how Beowulf lost
    swimming race. Beowulf then "sets the record straight" by telling everyone that he was doing a multitude 
    of other things other then just swimming.
</p>
<p class ="char_list" id = "Grendel"><b>Grendel:</b> Grendel is important because he is <b>the</b> first conflict
we see Beowulf deal with. Due to this he is built up as this super strong and overwelming monster that has been terrorizing 
Heorot for going on twelve winters. With this build up the reader gets the sense that Grendel is ultimately unstoppable.
So when Beowulf comes in and easily defeats Grendel, the reader begins to grasp the strength that Beowulf has.

<p class ="char_list" id = "Grendels_mother"><b>Grendel's Mother:</b> </p>
