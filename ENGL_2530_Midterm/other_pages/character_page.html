        <h2>Some of the Characters in Beowulf and how they are important to the story.</h2>
        </section>
</header>
 <p class="char_list" id = "Beowulf"><b>Beowulf:</b> He is important to the story he is one of the major enforcers of the 
     heroic ideal. Many other "good guys" in the story would like to enforce it and try, but Beowulf is 
     the only one that is able to actually go through with it up until the "third act". In the that part Wiglaf
     comes close when he runs in to try to help defend Beowulf from the dragon and as well as when he scolds the rest 
     of Beowulf's retainers for just running away when Beowulf needed them.
 </p>
 <p class ="char_list" id = "Unferth"><b>Unferth:</b> He is important to emphasize how amazing Beowulf is,
    we can see this leading up to Beowulf's fight with Grendel where where he cast doubt on how powerful 
    Beowulf is by mentioning another character, that is only talked about once, Breca and how Beowulf lost
    swimming race. Beowulf then "sets the record straight" by telling everyone that he was doing a multitude 
    of other things other then just swimming.
</p>
 <p class ="char_list" id = "Grendel"><b>Grendel:</b> Grendel is important because he is <b>the</b> first conflict
    we see Beowulf deal with. Due to this he is built up as this super strong and overwelming monster that has been terrorizing 
    Heorot for going on twelve winters. With this build up the reader gets the sense that Grendel is ultimately unstoppable.
    So when Beowulf comes in and easily defeats Grendel, the reader begins to grasp the strength that Beowulf has.  
 </p>
 <p class ="char_list" id = "Grendels_mother"><b>Grendel's Mother:</b> Grendel's Mother is one of the few people in the poem
    that appear to use her intelligence combined with her strength. Grendel when he started his attacks, he was fueled primarily 
    rage and from what we gather from the way acted when Beowulf confronted him that Grendel just runs in and 
    starts attacking. It seems that he never really considered, "Maybe they will be able to defeat me this time." 
    Where as with his mother, she did not really try to "sneak in" per se, but when she was caught she grabbed essentially
    a hostage and retreated. The reason that she retreated is up for debate that being either in fright of being overwelmed
    or as a bait for Beowulf, who may believe was the desired target when coming to the Heorot, to make him come to her
    lair where she would have more of an advantage.
