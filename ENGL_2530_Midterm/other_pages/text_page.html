        <h2>The reason the text of Beowulf is important to the literary world.</h2> 
</header>
 <p class="body">&emsp;To start off the major reason that the poem of Beowulf is so important and the fact that everyone in some capacity
     has heard of it is, it is the oldest surviving Old English. This means to try and get a better understaning of what 
     life was like at the time we could read this work. Without a doubt some of the things that happen in the poem are 
     exaggerated, but others such as the heroic ideal and the idea of kinship run rampant throughout it.   
 </p>
 <p class="body">&emsp;Another big thing that it does for the world of litature is it has a very apparent christian author
    writing for their christian audience about a group of mainly non-christians and still make it seem like the viliagers 
    are not the vilians of the story. We can see that thoughout the text due to the many refrences of "God" or the "Lord".
    Then another way that we see this interal conflict come out in the writing is with "Fate or Free Will", in the story 
    Beowulf is always proclaiming that it was his "fate" that won the day for him and that it was destined. I believe that 
    this is more a christian idea because God is suppose to be the defender of his people, but I believe if it was the actual
    people that Beowulf is representing think that they would believe in the free will due to the fact most non-christians at the 
    time believed in multipule gods and beings so there would be no guarantee that they would have someone looking out for them. </p>
