        <h2>The major themes that I saw in Beowulf.</h2> 
</header>
    <p class="theme"><b>Loyalty:</b> With the theme of loyality we can see this begining with the residents of Heorot,
     if they were not loyal to Heorot and Hrothgar surely there was another mead hall or vilage that Grendel did not 
    know about relatively near by, I use relatively because I am sure it was not right next door, but any distance would be
    enough if you are trying to survive. Instead they stayed with their king in his time of need may of them even died trying
    to the point were they were indifferent to the situation, sort of like "oh I wonder who's turn it is tonight", but they
    stayed. </p>
    <p class="theme"><b>Bravery and Valor:</b> With this one, I believe like many others Beowulf himself would be a good example 
    of this due to the fact that he is constantly bosting before every fight that he has never "totally" lost a fight, there has been 
    time, against his control, that he might have temporarily lost an engagement but he has never been killed (without killing the attacker
    first.)</p>
    <p class="theme"><b>Vengeance:</b> This theme is all thoughout the poem, from the kinsmen constantly trying to fight Grendel to no 
    avale to how Grendel's Mother was wanting to avenge her son. This one is a major part of the heroic ideal that is pretty much the basis
    of all of the works that came out around this time. It has tons of mentioning the man-price which is code for vengance.</p>
    <p class="theme"><b>Generosity and Hospitality:</b> These themes appear when it comes to Hrothgar and Beowulf. Yes, Beowulf was at 
    Heorot to defeat Grendel and his mother it is implied that he stayed in the meed hall and ate with them. Yes Beowulf and his men were 
    paid for his troubles, but Hrothgar did not have to feed them or give them a place to stay. Then at the end after Beowulf died the poem 
    left of with <em>"They said that of all the kings upon the earth he was the man most gracious and fair-minded, kindest to his people and keenest 
    to win fame"</em> which shows that Beowulf was very generous to his people and anyone who would show him the same courtesy.
