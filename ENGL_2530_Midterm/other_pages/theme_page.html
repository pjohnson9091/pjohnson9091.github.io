        <h2>The major themes that I saw in Beowulf.</h2> 
</header>
    <p class="theme"><b>Loyalty:</b> With the theme of loyality we can see this begining with the residents of Heorot,
     if they were not loyal to Heorot and Hrothgar surely there was another mead hall or vilage that Grendel did not 
    know about relatively near by, I use relatively because I am sure it was not right next door, but any distance would be
    enough if you are trying to survive. Instead they stayed with their king in his time of need may of them even died trying
    to the point were they were indifferent to the situation, sort of like "oh I wonder who's turn it is tonight", but they
    stayed. </p>
    <p class="theme"><b>Bravery and Valor:</b> With this one, I believe like many others Beowulf himself would be a good example 
    of this due to the fact that he is constantly bosting before every fight that he has never "totally" lost a fight, there has been 
    time, against his control, that he might have temporarily lost an engagement but he has never been killed (without killing the attacker
    first.)</p>
    <p class="theme"><b>Vengeance:</b> </p>
    <p class="theme"><b>Generosity and Hospitality:</b> </p>
